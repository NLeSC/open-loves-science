## Open ❤ Science

Cards and code to create cards for Open❤️Science, an educational game
similar to Apples to Apples.
This game can be played in person or online. If you are interested
in the printed game, please reach out to us ([rdm@vu.nl](mailto:rdm@vu.nl))

## Goal of the Game

Welcome to Open Loves Science, a card game designed to spark playful yet
insightful dialogues about the Open Science movement. As players delve
into an array of topics related to this stream of research reform,
they are encouraged to reflect on their contributions and beliefs
towards transforming the academic landscape. This game celebrates the
essence of Open Science - fostering connections. It invites players to
look into each other's eyes, exchange ideas, and deepen their
understanding of each other and each other’s research.
