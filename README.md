# Open Loves Science

This repository contains the website, cards, and code to create cards for Open❤️Science, a educational game similar to Apples to Apples.
This game can be played in person or online. If you are interested in the printed game, please reach out to us (rdm@vu.nl).

## Goal of the Game

In Open❤️Science, players are invited to engage in playful and deep conversations about Open Science.
The card game features an encyclopedia of issues that pervade this movement of research reform and ask
participants to consider their role and values in changing academic culture. Like Open Science, this
game is about connection. Players are meant to look into each other’s eyes, engage in conversation,
and better understand one another. 

## How to Play

🧍3-7 players		⏰ 30 - 75 minutes	🏋️ difficulty level: researcher friendly

Players start with a hand of seven white cards featuring concepts pertinent to Open Science,
which are contextualised via their corresponding link. A player is selected to be the first judge,
and that judge plays a red card, which presents a larger Open Science topic. The round is won by
playing the white card that the judge determines to be the match for the red card. The role of the
judge rotates, and the number of rounds is determined by the number of players.
